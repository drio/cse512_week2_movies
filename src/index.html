<h2> The Movie Dataset </h2>
<p> This is an exploratory data analysis exercise that uses this 
<a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/a2.html">movies</a> 
dataset.

<h3> Inspecting the data </h3>
<p> The csv file contains 3201 movies for each movie we have the following 
attributes (not all the movies have all the attributes set): </p>
<pre>
0: "Title" 1: "US Gross" 2: "Worldwide Gross" 3: "US DVD Sales" 4: "Production Budget"
5: "Release Date" 6: "MPAA Rating" 7: "Running Time (min)" 8: "Distributor"
9: "Source" 10: "Major Genre" 11: "Creative Type" 12: "Director"
13: "Rotten Tomatoes Rating" 14: "IMDB Rating" 15: "IMDB Votes"
</pre>

<p> Let's inspect the number of uniq values available per attribute on the dataset:

<pre>
US Gross 3061 | Worldwide Gross 3075 | US DVD Sales 565 | Production Budget 382
Release Date 1604| MPAA Rating 8 | Running Time (min) 110 | Distributor 175
Source 19 | Major Genre 13 | Creative Type 10 | Director 551 
Rotten Tomatoes Rating 101 | IMDB Rating 78 | IMDB Votes 2840
</pre>

<h3> Distributions for the numerical attributes </h3>

<p> Here I want to take a look to how the values distribute for the numerical variables 
of the movies. I want to do that to see if something interesting comes out so we can 
dig a bit deeper.

<div id="viz-histogram-container"></div>

<p> Now that I know a bit more about the dataset, what are some interesting questions?

<p> First, there a few entries with incorrect release dates. I apply various filters
to clean up the data. After that bit of cleaning, I end up with 1372 movies.

<h2> Questions</h2>

<h3> Are movies during the holidays more likely to have worse ratings? </h3>

<p> To answer that we need the budget, ratings (remember we have rotten
tomatoes and imdb) and the release date. Let's hack...

<p>
Year start: <select id="year-start"> </select>
Year end: <select id="year-end"> </select>

<div id="viz-dotplot-container"></div>

<p> I don't see any particular trend in the data that suggest bad movies (low
ratings) with high revenue for the holidays. We should see more dots in the
bottom right quadrant for the summer and Christmas. Each dotplot contains data
for a particular month starting with January (first dotplot) and ending in
December (bottom right dotplot).

<p> A lot of filtering and cleaning and digging here but I can't confirm my
hypothesis.  I tried to look at both ratings by combining them when available. 

<p> We could look at the data starting in older years. Does the hypothesis hold then? 
Also, we would like to provide controls so we can dynamically update the dataset by 
changing things like: movie year.

<p> I have to hack the viz so I can check the title for movies with high
ratings so I can see if I have seen them. Done (via console).

<h3> Is there an overlap in interest between US and the rest of the world? </h3>

Here I am plotting the revenue for the movie in the US (x) and the rest of the world (y). 
It seems there is:

<div id="viz-usvsworld-container">
  <div id="viz-usvsworld-viz">
  </div>
</div>

<h3> Are there directors releasing consistently high rated movies? </h3>
<p> Here each dot is a director. The Axis show average revenue and average ratings for all of their movies. The size of the dot encodes the number of movies for the director.
<div id="viz-directors-info">Move over a dot to reveal director's info.</div>
<div id="viz-directors"></div>
<p> The next step here would be to consider the budget of the movies to see what directors are more appealing for movie companies.

<h3> Other questions </h3>
<p> Another question: is there an increase in budget over time (adjusted to inflation)?
<p> Another question: Do movies with more budget have better ratings?
<p> Another question: Do popular (more votes) movies get better or worse ratings?
