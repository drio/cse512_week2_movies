  <p> Now that I know a bit more about the dataset, what are some interesting questions?

  <h4> How many movies do we have per year? </h4>

  <p> First, there a few entries with incorrect release dates. I am going to only
  work with movies that have a valid year. To accomplish that, I am only work
  with years where we have more than 5 movies. In addition, I only process movies
  for which I can parse the data. After that bit of cleaning, I end up with 3047 movies 
  that range from year 1970 to 2010. 

  <h4> More interesting questions: Are bad movies, with a big budget, released during the 
       holidays?</h4>

  <p> This is a more interesting question. To answer that we need the budget, ratings (remember
  we have rotten tomatoes and imdb) and the release date. Let's hack...

	<div id="viz-dotplot-container"></div>

	<p> I don't see any particular trend in the data that suggest bad movies (low ratings) with high
  budget for the holidays. We should see more dots in the bottom right quadrant for the summer and 
	Christmas. Each dotplot contains data for a particular month starting with January (first dotplot) and
  ending in December (bottom right dotplot).
