  <h2> The Movie Dataset </h2>

  <h3> Inspecting the data </h3>
  <p> The csv file contains 3201 movies for each movie we have the following attributes (not all the movies have all the attributes set): </p>
  <pre>
  0: "Title"
  1: "US Gross"
  2: "Worldwide Gross"
  3: "US DVD Sales"
  4: "Production Budget"
  5: "Release Date"
  6: "MPAA Rating"
  7: "Running Time (min)"
  8: "Distributor"
  9: "Source"
  10: "Major Genre"
  11: "Creative Type"
  12: "Director"
  13: "Rotten Tomatoes Rating"
  14: "IMDB Rating"
  15: "IMDB Votes"
  </pre>

  <p> Let's inspect the number of uniq values available per attribute on the dataset:

  <pre>
  US Gross 3061
  Worldwide Gross 3075
  US DVD Sales 565
  Production Budget 382
  Release Date 1604
  MPAA Rating 8
  Running Time (min) 110
  Distributor 175
  Source 19
  Major Genre 13
  Creative Type 10
  Director 551
  Rotten Tomatoes Rating 101
  IMDB Rating 78
  IMDB Votes 2840
  </pre>

<h3> Distributions for the numerical attributes </h3>

<p> Here I want to take a look to how the values distribute for the numerical variables 
of the movies. I want to do that to see if something interesting comes out so we can 
dig a bit deeper.

<div id="viz-histogram-container"></div>

<p> Now that I know a bit more about the dataset, what are some interesting questions?

<h3> How many movies do we have per year? </h3>

<p> First, there a few entries with incorrect release dates. I am going to only
work with movies that have a valid year. To accomplish that, I am only work
with years where we have more than 5 movies. In addition, I only process movies
for which I can parse the data. After that bit of cleaning, I end up with 3047 movies 
that range from year 1970 to 2010. 

<h3> More interesting questions: Are bad movies, with a big budget, released during the 
     holidays?</h3>

<p> This is a more interesting question. To answer that we need the budget, ratings (remember
we have rotten tomatoes and imdb) and the release date. Let's hack...

<p>
Year start:
<select id="year-start"> 
  <option value="1975">1975</option>
</select>
Year end:
<select id="year-end"> 
  <option value="2010">2010</option>
</select>

<div id="viz-dotplot-container"></div>

<p> I don't see any particular trend in the data that suggest bad movies (low
ratings) with high revenue for the holidays. We should see more dots in the
bottom right quadrant for the summer and Christmas. Each dotplot contains data
for a particular month starting with January (first dotplot) and ending in
December (bottom right dotplot).

<p> A lot of filtering and cleaning and digging here but I can't confirm my
hypothesis.  I tried to look at both ratings by combining them when available. 

<p> Another lesson learned: Clean clean and clean the data. And make sure it is
correct and you don't have bugs in your code that introduce errors.

<p> We could look at the data starting in older years. Does the hypothesis hold then? 
Also, we would like to provide controls so we can dynamically update the dataset by 
changing things like: movie year, 

<p> Another question: is there an increase in budget over time (adjusted to inflation)?
<p> Another question: Do movies with more budget have better ratings?
<p> Another question: Do popular (more votes) movies get better or worse ratings?

<p> Are there directors releasing consistency highly rated movies?

<p> I have to hack the viz so I can check the title for movies with high
ratings so I can see if I have seen them. Done (via console).

<h3> Is there an overlap in interest between US and the rest of the world? </h3>

Here I am plotting the revenue for the movie in the US (x) and the rest of the world (y). 
It seems there is:
